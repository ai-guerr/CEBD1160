#Advanced Question

Based on the 'diabetes' data set provided, the primary graph I used to interpret data was the correlation matrix.  
* This graph served to quickly identify the attributes to focus on for deeper analysis in order to understand the patterns around the diabetes outcome values.
* Based on this graph, I was able segregate the data set based as a function of BMI categories (Overweight, Normal weight, Underweight)
* This segregation led to the more useful targeted application of the scatter plot and box plot.
* Without the initial view provided by the correlation matrix, the direct application of the scatter is not as visually informative or indicative of the weight-dependent pattern of the diabetes outcome.
